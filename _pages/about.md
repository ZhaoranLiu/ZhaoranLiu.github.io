About Me
------

I am a fifth-year PhD student at the [Astronomical Institute of Tohoku University](https://www.astr.tohoku.ac.jp/en/), supervised by [Prof. Tadayuki Kodama](http://mahalo.galaxy.bindcloud.jp/pg39.html). 

As an observational astronomer, my research focuses on understanding the physical processes that drive galaxy evolution by linking the internal properties of galaxies with their large-scale cosmic environments. I am particularly interested in dust-obscured star formation, and I work on using multi-phase interstellar medium diagnostics to uncover the hidden star-forming activities that are invisible in UV-to-optical surveys.

Outside of research, I enjoy swimming, hiking, and taking my cat to nearby parks to enjoy the fresh air on sunny days.
