About Me
------

I am a fourth-year PhD student at the Astronomical Institute of Tohoku University, researching galaxy formation and evolution under the supervision of Professor [Tadayuki Kodama](http://mahalo.galaxy.bindcloud.jp/pg39.html). My work focuses on studying galaxies within cluster environments using narrowband imaging with the Subaru Telescope. We employ multiple narrowband filters to constrain star formation and dust extinction in distant clusters, aiming to understand how the environment influences galaxy formation and evolution.

In addition to studying large-scale structures in the early universe, I am interested in the physical processes that drive star formation within individual galaxies. Motivated by this interest, I collaborate with [Dr. Takahiro Morishita](https://mtakahiro.github.io), utilizing JWST NIRCam and MIRI imaging, as well as NIRCam WFSS, to investigate spatially resolved star formation obscured by dust.
