About Me
------

I am a postdoctoral scholar at the MIT Kavli Institute, working with [Dr. Rohan Naidu](https://rohannaidu.github.io) and [Prof. Robert Simcoe](http://simcoe.mit.edu). My research broadly focuses on the co-evolution of galaxies and their surrounding environments, as well as the diverse physical processes that shape massive galaxies.

Before moving to Boston, I obtained my PhD in Astronomy at the [Astronomical Institute of Tohoku University](https://www.astr.tohoku.ac.jp/en/), supervised by [Prof. Tadayuki Kodama](http://mahalo.galaxy.bindcloud.jp/pg39.html). My doctoral research combined ground-based narrow-band surveys and space-based slitless spectroscopy to study the formation of dust-obscured galaxies.

Outside of research, I enjoy swimming, hiking, and taking my cat to nearby parks to enjoy the fresh air on sunny days.
