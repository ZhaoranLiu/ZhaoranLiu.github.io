About Me
------

I am a fifth-year PhD student at the Astronomical Institute of Tohoku University, supervised by [Prof. Tadayuki Kodama](http://mahalo.galaxy.bindcloud.jp/pg39.html). As an observational astronomer, I aim to understand the fundamental processes that drive galaxy evolution by linking the internal mechanisms within galaxies to their larger cosmic environments. 

My research centers on two primary areas:

1. I explore how galaxies co-evolve with their surrounding structures, examining the cosmic webâ€™s role in fueling them and the environmental factors that lead to their early quenching relative to field galaxies. I use the Subaru Telescope's narrow-band imaging to study galaxy evolution across various environments.
Key questions I seek to answer include:

*When, how, and why does galaxy evolution shift from high star formation in early protoclusters to the quiescent populations seen in local clusters?
*What conditions, such as ram pressure stripping, drive this transition and accelerate the emergence of passive galaxies?


3. Galaxy Evolution Through a Spatially Resolved View: I aim to trace how galaxies build their structures through components like molecular gas, ionized gas, and dust. Analyzing these elements reveals how galaxies assemble via cold gas inflow, active star formation, and the processes that lead to quenching, such as gas consumption, bulge stabilization, and environmental interactions. Together with [Dr. Takahiro Morishita](https://mtakahiro.github.io) , I use data from JWST MIRI, JWST NIRCam WFSS, and ALMA to investigate the structural formation of galaxies.


My ultimate goal is to combine these two scales and conduct a comprehensive study of galaxies in large-scale structures with a spatially resolved view of their key components. I wish to understand every stage of galaxy formation in different surrounding environments, from the first protoclusters to mature local clusters. I am particularly interested in conducting such surveys with ground-based IFU and narrow-band imaging, as well as space-based slitless spectroscopy. I am fascinated by the power of JWST NIRCam slitless spectroscopy and would like to expand my research to include Roman slitless spectroscopy in the next few years.


Outside of work, I enjoy swimming, hiking, and taking my cat to nearby parks to enjoy the fresh air on good-weather days.
