About Me
------

I am a third-year PhD student at the Astronomical Institute of Tohoku University. I consider myself fortunate to be conducting my research in the field of galaxy formation and evolution under the guidance of Professor [Tadayuki Kodama](http://mahalo.galaxy.bindcloud.jp/pg39.html). Prior to this, I obtained my bachelor's degree in Astronomy from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC). My research interests primarily revolve around studying dust-obscured formation activities in galaxies, as well as exploring the processes of galaxy formation within large-scale structures.
