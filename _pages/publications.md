### Accelerated Emergence of Evolved Galaxies in Early Overdensities at *z* ~ 5.7

**Morishita, T.**, **Liu, Z.**, Stiavelli, M., Treu, T., Trenti, M., Chartab, N., Roberts-Borsani, G., Vulcani, B., Bergamini, P., Castellano, M., Grillo, C.

*[arXiv:2408.10980](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10980)*

*In this paper, we investigate the rapid emergence of evolved galaxies in early overdense regions at redshift ~5.7 using data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Our findings suggest that...*

### A Multiwavelength Investigation of Dust and Stellar Mass Distributions in Galaxies: Insights from High-resolution JWST Imaging

**Liu, Z.**, Morishita, T., Kodama, T.

*[The Astrophysical Journal, 955, 29L](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023ApJ...955...29L/abstract)*

*In this publication, we explore the distributions of dust and stellar mass in galaxies through a multiwavelength approach. High-resolution imaging from the JWST allows us to gain new insights into galaxy formation and evolution by...*
