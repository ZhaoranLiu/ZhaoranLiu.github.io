### Accelerated Emergence of Evolved Galaxies in Early Overdensities at *z* ~ 5.7

Morishita, T., **Liu, Z.**, Stiavelli, M., Treu, T., Trenti, M., Chartab, N., Roberts-Borsani, G., Vulcani, B., Bergamini, P., Castellano, M., Grillo, C.

*[arXiv:2408.10980](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10980)*

*In the local universe, galaxy clusters are dominated by quiescent, massive galaxies with old stellar populations, whereas galaxies in high-redshift protoclusters show enhanced star formation fueled by cold gas from the cosmic web. The transition between these states—when, how, and why galaxies shift from active star formation to quiescence—is not well understood. In this paper, we investigate the suppression of star formation in galaxies within overdensities at z > 5, an epoch much earlier than typical environmental quenching. What physical processes lead to this early quenching? We present evidence that these quiescent galaxies exhibit stronger Balmer breaks compared to their field counterparts. Do galaxies in early overdensities favor bursty star formation, building up their stellar mass and quenching early, rather than accumulating mass through constant star formation?*


### Characterizing Dust Extinction and Spatially Resolved Paschen-α Emission within 97 Galaxies at 1 < *z* < 1.6 with JWST NIRCam Slitless Spectroscopy

**Liu, Z.**, Morishita, T., Kodama, T.

*[arXiv:2406.11188](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11188)*

Young stars emit intense radiation that ionizes the surrounding hydrogen, creating H II regions—the sites of active star formation. Unlike the Hα emission line, which can be strongly attenuated by dust, Paschen-α is a dust-insensitive tracer of these ionized regions. In this paper, we present the first spatially resolved studies of Paschen-α emission lines at z > 1 using JWST NIRCam slitless spectroscopy. Analyzing 97 galaxies within the redshift range 1 < z < 1.6, we discover diverse star formation regions traced by Paschen-α. These findings raise intriguing questions about the varied ways galaxies build up their massive structures and the origins of different star formation modes.*

### A Multiwavelength Investigation of Dust and Stellar Mass Distributions in Galaxies: Insights from High-resolution JWST Imaging

**Liu, Z.**, Morishita, T., Kodama, T.

*[The Astrophysical Journal, 955, 29L](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023ApJ...955...29L/abstract)*

*The Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) offers wide wavelength coverage and high spatial resolution, surpassing the capabilities of previous infrared telescopes like Spitzer. In this paper, we introduce a new algorithm to decompose the dust (specifically, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon [PAH] emission) and stellar components of galaxies by combining SED fitting with NIRCam and MIRI imaging. We investigate the spatial profiles of PAH emission and stellar mass to determine where dust is distributed within galaxies and the events they may be associated with. Our results show that PAH emission is, on average, more compact than the stellar component, which may hint at rapid bulge build-up, yet the most massive galaxy exhibit extended dust profile - is this a hint of inside-out quenching?*
